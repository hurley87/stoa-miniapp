# How Stoa Works: A Simple Guide

## What is Stoa?

Stoa is a modern forum of ideas built onchain.

The Logos frame the discourse; the crowd carries it forward.

### Creating a Question

1. **Frame the Discourse**: Choose a topic worth debating or a problem worth solving
2. **Set the Stakes**: Define the cost to answer (this funds the reward pool)
3. **Choose Duration**: Decide how long answers will be accepted
4. **Define Winners**: Select how many top answers will be rewarded

### What You Earn

As a member of the Logos, you earn **10% of all submission fees** for every question you ask.
