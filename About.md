# How Stoa Works: A Simple Guide

## What is Stoa?

Stoa is a modern forum of ideas built onchain.  
Question creators ask; anyone can answer.  
Creators frame the discourse; the crowd carries it forward.

By asking, answering, and earning, you take part in a system where knowledge has real weight.

## For creators (question askers)

### Creating a Question

1. **Frame the Discourse**: Choose a topic worth debating or a problem worth solving
2. **Set the Stakes**: Define the cost to answer (this funds the reward pool)
3. **Choose Duration**: Decide how long answers will be accepted
4. **Define Winners**: Select how many top answers will be rewarded

### What You Earn

As a creator, you earn **10% of all submission fees** for every question you ask.  
If 20 people each pay 10 tokens to answer your question, you earn 20 tokens simply for curating the discourse.
