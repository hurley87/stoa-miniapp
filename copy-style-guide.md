# Stoa Copywriting Style Guide

## Tone

- Clear, simple, and product-focused
- With a touch of classical flair (Greek/Roman language, but not overwhelming)
- Professional yet playful, crypto-native voice

## Vocabulary

- **Stoa** = the protocol, the forum, the place of discourse
- **Logos** = chosen council, those who may ask questions
- **Answerers** = the wider community who respond
- **Discourse** = the overall conversation
- Use phrases like _“Ask. Answer. Earn.”_ and _“Where questions shape discourse.”_ as guiding taglines

## Structure

- **Headings:** plain, straightforward, and easy to scan
- **Body:** inject classical terms sparingly, give context (never leave users guessing)
- **Callouts/Taglines:** where the classical flair shines brightest

## Key Principles

- Always highlight **skin in the game** (fees, rewards, fairness)
- Frame Logos as **curators of questions**
- Make clear that **anyone may answer, but only Logos may ask**
- Keep copy **short and punchy**, avoid jargon
- Reinforce **trust, transparency, fairness**
