# Stoa Copywriting Style Guide

## Tone

- Clear, playful, and crypto-native
- Feels like a game, not an academic forum
- Short sentences, action-first language
- Mix of sharp and witty, but not sarcastic

---

## Vocabulary

- **Stoa** = the brand, the game, the arena of prompts and replies
- **Game** = each prompt round (replaces “challenge/match”)
- **Prompt** = the question/topic posed by a KOL (replaces “question”)
- **Reply** = a player’s take or answer (replaces “answer”)
- **KOL (Prompt Creator)** = the person who starts a game by dropping a prompt
- **Reply Guy** = the player who replies to a prompt (plural: Reply Guys; neutral fallback: “Players”)
- **Prize Pool** = reward pool funded by entry fees (replaces “reward pool”)
- **Entry Fee** = cost to reply (replaces “submission fee”)
- **Judging** = evaluation of replies
- **AI Judge** = automated scoring of clarity, originality, accuracy
- **Whitelisted Human Judge** = trusted human who finalizes rewards
- **Protocol Treasury** = protocol’s cut of entry fees

## Token Structure (always shown this way)

- **10%** → Protocol Treasury
- **10%** → KOL (Prompt Creator)
- **5%** → Referrer (if provided)
- **75%** → Prize Pool (for top replies)

---

## Rules of Play (loop)

- **Prompt → Reply → Get Judged → Win**
- This phrase anchors the experience and should appear in onboarding, landing pages, and empty states.

---

## Key Messaging Principles

- **Accessible**: Avoid jargon unless crypto-native (e.g., “onchain” is fine).
- **Game-like**: Use verbs like _Start Game_, _Pay to Reply_, _Claim Rewards_.
- **Skin in the game**: Emphasize that stakes are real, rewards are earned.
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Playful but never confusing.

---

## Copy Examples

**Hero Line:**  
“Stoa is the onchain game of prompts and replies. KOLs drop the prompts. Reply Guys fire back. The best takes win rewards.”

**CTA Buttons:**

- “Start a Game” (for KOLs)
- “Drop a Prompt”
- “Pay to Reply”
- “Post Reply”
- “View Judging”
- “Claim Rewards”
- “Apply to be a KOL”
- “Apply to be a Judge”

**Empty States:**

- Games list: “No open games yet. Be the first to **Drop a Prompt**.”
- Prompt detail (no replies): “Be the first Reply Guy. **Pay to Reply** and make your move.”
- Rewards: “No rewards yet—rank in the top replies to claim.”

**Judging Clarifier:**  
“All judging is AI-assisted and finalized by whitelisted Human Judges.”

## Style Notes

- **Capitalization**: Game terms (Prompt, Reply, KOL, Reply Guy, Judge, Prize Pool) are capitalized when used as roles or mechanics.
- **Clarity**: Always show the breakdown of token flow in plain numbers (10/10/5/75).
- **Consistency**: Never mix old terms (“question,” “answer,” “submission fee,” etc.).
- **Playfulness**: Lean into Reply Guy internet culture, but keep it sharp not mocking.
