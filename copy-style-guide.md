# Stoa Copywriting Style Guide

## Tone

- Clear, simple, and product-focused
- Epic but approachable (arena / game language, classical flair when it amplifies the idea)
- Professional yet playful, crypto-native voice

## Vocabulary

- **Stoa** = the protocol, the arena, the game itself
- **Questions** = rounds, matches, prompts
- **Answers** = moves, entries, plays
- **Arena** = the space where competition happens
- Use phrases like _“Ask. Answer. Earn.”_ and _“Where the best answers win.”_ as guiding taglines

## Structure

- **Headings:** short, declarative, easy to scan
- **Body:** keep copy direct; add classical/game flavor only when it makes the message stronger
- **Callouts/Taglines:** punchy, memorable, with slight epic flair

## Key Principles

- Highlight **skin in the game** — players pay to enter, best answers get rewarded
- Frame questions as **contests** and answers as **competing moves**
- Make clear that **anyone can answer, but only the best win**
- Keep language **short, punchy, and non-technical**
- Reinforce **fairness and fun** — AI as neutral judge, tokens as prize

## Core Taglines

- **“A competitive Q&A game where the best answers win tokens.”**
- **“One arena, many questions — where ideas compete and the best get paid.”**
- **“Ask. Answer. Earn.”**

## Do / Don’t

**Do**

- Use words like _arena, contest, game, round, prize_ to make it feel competitive and fun
- Keep sentences short and declarative
- Emphasize fairness, transparency, and rewards
- Make classical references sparingly, as seasoning

**Don’t**

- Don’t use heavy jargon (avoid “staking,” “gas,” “protocol mechanics” in user-facing copy)
- Don’t overuse classical language (skip obscure Greek/Roman terms)
- Don’t make it sound like gambling — focus on competition and knowledge, not luck
- Don’t get too wordy — clarity always wins
